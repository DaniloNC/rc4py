rc4py
=====

Pure Python implentation of the RC4 stream cipher.

This is a simple object oriented implementation of the RC4 stream
cipher. The implementation supports any key length from 8 to 256 bits.

The implementation includes test vectors to check the
functionality. The examples directory includes a simple example of how
to instantiate the RC4 class and use it to generate a keystream.
